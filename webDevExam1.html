        <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
            The first human inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago have been traced to the Paleolithic, around 38-40,000 years ago.
            [1] The Jōmon period, named after its cord-marked pottery, was followed by the Yayoi period in the first millennium BC when new inventions were introduced from Asia.
            During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese Book of Han in the first century AD.
            Around the 3rd century BC, the Yayoi people from the continent immigrated to the Japanese archipelago and introduced iron technology and agricultural civilization.
            [2] Because they had an agricultural civilization, the population of the Yayoi began to grow rapidly and ultimately overwhelmed the Jōmon people, natives of the Japanese archipelago
            who were hunter-gatherers.[3] Between the fourth and ninth centuries, Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, nominally controlled by the Emperor of Japan.
            The imperial dynasty established at this time continues to this day, albeit in an almost entirely ceremonial role. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), marking the beginning of the Heian period, which lasted until 1185. 
            The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.

            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
            Over the following centuries, the power of the imperial house decreased, passing first to great clans of civilian aristocrats – most notably the Fujiwara – and then to the military clans and their armies of samurai.
            The Minamoto clan under Minamoto no Yoritomo emerged victorious from the Genpei War of 1180–85, defeating their rival military clan, the Taira. After seizing power, Yoritomo set up his capital in Kamakura and took the title of shōgun. In 1274 and 1281, the Kamakura shogunate withstood two Mongol invasions, 
            but in 1333 it was toppled by a rival claimant to the shogunate, ushering in the Muromachi period. During this period, regional warlords called daimyō grew in power at the expense of the shōgun. Eventually, Japan descended into a period of civil war. Over the course of the late 16th century, Japan was reunified 
            under the leadership of the prominent daimyō Oda Nobunaga and his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Toyotomi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu came to power and was appointed shōgun by the emperor. The Tokugawa shogunate, which governed from Edo (modern Tokyo), presided over a prosperous and peaceful era known as the Edo period (1600–1868).
             The Tokugawa shogunate imposed a strict class system on Japanese society and cut off almost all contact with the outside world.

        <h1>I. Ancient Japan</h1>
            <h2>Paleolithic Period</h2>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                    <dfn><title>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Paleolithic</title></dfn>
                    Hunter-gatherers arrived in Japan in Paleolithic times, with the oldest evidence dating to around 38-40,000 years ago.[1] Little evidence of their presence remains, as Japan's acidic soils are inhospitable to the process of fossilization.
                    However, the discovery of unique edge-ground axes in Japan dated to over 30,000 years ago may be evidence of the first Homo sapiens in Japan.[4] Early humans likely arrived in Japan by sea on watercraft.[5] Evidence of human habitation has
                    been dated to 32,000 years ago in Okinawa's Yamashita Cave[6] and up to 20,000 years ago on Ishigaki Island's Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave.    
                </p> 
            <h2>Jomon Period</h2>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                    The Jōmon period of prehistoric Japan spans from roughly 13,000 BC[8] to about 1,000 BC.[9] Japan was inhabited by a predominantly hunter-gatherer culture that reached a considerable degree of sedentism and cultural complexity.
                    [10] The name Jōmon, meaning "cord-marked", was first applied by American scholar Edward S. Morse, who discovered shards of pottery in 1877.[11] The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of Jōmon culture was decorated 
                    impressing cords into the surface of wet clay.[12] Jōmon pottery is generally accepted to be among the oldest in East Asia and the world.    

                </p>
        <h2>Yayoi Period</h2>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                    During the Yayoi period, the Yayoi tribes gradually coalesced into a number of kingdoms. In the earliest written work to unambiguously mention Japan, the Book of Han, published in 111 AD, states that one hundred kingdoms comprised Japan, which is referred to as Wa.
                    A later Chinese work of history, the Book of Wei, states that by 240 AD, the powerful kingdom of Yamatai, ruled by the female monarch Himiko, had gained ascendancy over the others, though modern historians continue to debate its location and other aspects of its 
                    depiction in the Book of Wei.    

                </p>

        <h2>Kofun Period</h2>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                    During the subsequent Kofun period, Japan gradually unified under a single territory. The symbol of the growing power of Japan's new leaders was the kofun burial mounds they constructed from around 250 AD onwards.
                    [25] Many were of massive scales, such as the Daisenryō Kofun, a 486 m-long keyhole-shaped burial mound that took huge teams of laborers fifteen years to complete. It is commonly accepted that the tomb was built for Emperor Nintoku.
                    [26] The kofun were often surrounded by and filled with numerous haniwa clay sculptures, often in the shape of warriors and horses.

        <h1>II. Classical Japan</h1>
            <h2>Asuka Period (538-710)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                The Asuka period began as early as 538 AD with the introduction of the Buddhist religion from the Korean kingdom of Baekje.
                [30] Since then, Buddhism has coexisted with Japan's native Shinto religion, in what is today known as Shinbutsu-shūgō.
                [31] The period draws its name from the de facto imperial capital, Asuka, in the Kinai region.  

            </p>
            <h2>Nara Period (710-794)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                During this period, Japan suffered a series of natural disasters, including wildfires, droughts, famines, and outbreaks of disease,
                such as a smallpox epidemic in 735–737 that killed over a quarter of the population.[45] Emperor Shōmu (r. 724–749) feared his lack of
                piousness had caused the trouble and so increased the government's promotion of Buddhism, including the construction of the 
                Tōdai-ji in 752.[46] The funds to build this temple were raised in part by the influential Buddhist monk Gyōki, and once 
                it was used by the Chinese monk Ganjin as an ordination site.[47] Japan nevertheless entered a phase of population decline that 
                continued well into the following Heian period.[48] There was also a serious attempt to overthrow the Imperial house during the 
                middle Nara period. During the 760s, monk Dōkyō tried to establish his own dynasty by the aid of Empress Shōtoku, but after her death
                 in 770 he lost all his power and was exiled. The Fujiwara clan furthermore consolidated its power.  
            </p>
            <h2>Heian Period (794-1185)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                In 784, the capital moved briefly to Nagaoka-kyō, then again in 794 to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto),
                 which remained the capital until 1868.[49] Political power within the court soon passed to the Fujiwara clan,
                  a family of court nobles who grew increasingly close to the imperial family through intermarriage.
                  [50] Between 812 and 814 CE, a smallpox epidemic killed almost half of the Japanese population.  

            </p>
            
        <h1>III. Feudal Japan</h1>

            <h2>Kamakura Period (1185-1333)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                Upon the consolidation of power, Minamoto no Yoritomo chose to rule in concert with the Imperial Court in Kyoto.
                Though Yoritomo set up his own government in Kamakura in the Kantō region located in eastern Japan, its power was
                 legally authorized by the Imperial court in Kyoto in several occasions. In 1192, the emperor declared Yoritomo seii
                  tai-shōgun (征夷大将軍; Eastern Barbarian Subduing Great General), abbreviated as shōgun.[70] Yoritomo's government 
                  was called the bakufu (幕府 ("tent government")), referring to the tents where his soldiers encamped. 
                  The English term shogunate refers to the bakufu.[71] Japan remained largely under military rule until 1868.  

            </p>

            <h2>Muromachi Period (1333-1568)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                Takauji and many other samurai soon became dissatisfied with Emperor Go-Daigo's Kenmu Restoration,
                 an ambitious attempt to monopolize power in the imperial court. 
                 Takauji rebeled after Go-Daigo refused to appoint him shōgun.
                  In 1338, Takauji captured Kyoto and installed a rival member of the imperial family to the throne,
                   Emperor Kōmyō, who did appoint him shogun.[86] Go-Daigo responded by fleeing to the southern city of Yoshino,
                    where he set up a rival government. 
                This ushered in a prolonged period of conflict between the Northern Court and the Southern Court.
            </p>

            <h2>Azuchi-Momoya Period (1568-1600)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                Takauji and many other samurai soon became dissatisfied with Emperor Go-Daigo's Kenmu Restoration,
                 an ambitious attempt to monopolize power in the imperial court. 
                 Takauji rebeled after Go-Daigo refused to appoint him shōgun.
                  In 1338, Takauji captured Kyoto and installed a rival member of the imperial family to the throne,
                   Emperor Kōmyō, who did appoint him shogun.[86] Go-Daigo responded by fleeing to the southern city of Yoshino,
                    where he set up a rival government.

        <h1>IV. Early Modern Japan</h1>
            <h2>Edo Period (1600-1868)</h2>
            <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                The Edo period was characterized by relative peace and stability[119] under the tight control of the Tokugawa shogunate,
                 which ruled from the eastern city of Edo (modern Tokyo).[120] In 1603, Emperor Go-Yōzei declared Tokugawa Ieyasu shōgun,
                  and Ieyasu abdicated two years later to groom his son as the second shōgun of what became a long dynasty.
                  [121] Nevertheless, it took time for the Tokugawas to consolidate their rule. In 1609, 
                  the shōgun gave the daimyō of the Satsuma Domain permission to invade the Ryukyu Kingdom for perceived insults towards the shogunate;
                   the Satsuma victory began 266 years of Ryukyu's dual subordination to Satsuma and China.
                [99][122] Ieyasu led the Siege of Osaka that ended with the destruction of the Toyotomi clan in 1615.
            </p>
            <h3 style = " text-align: center;">
                <h3>Culture and Philosophy </h3>
                <p style = "text-align: justify;">The Edo period was a time of cultural flourishing, as the merchant classes grew in wealth and began spending their income on cultural and social pursuits
                        140][141] Members of the merchant class who patronized culture and entertainment were said to live hedonistic lives, which came to be called the ukiyo ("floating world").
                        [142] This lifestyle inspired ukiyo-zōshi popular novels and ukiyo-e art, the latter of which were often woodblock prints[143] that progressed to greater sophistication and use of multiple printed colors.[144]
                    </p>
                    <h3>Decline fall of the Shogunate </h3>
                    <p style = "text-align: justify;">
                        By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the shogunate showed signs of weakening
                        [151] The dramatic growth of agriculture that had characterized the early Edo period had ended,
                        [133] and the government handled the devastating Tenpō famines poorly.
                        [151] Peasant unrest grew and government revenues fell.
                        [152] The shogunate cut the pay of the already financially distressed samurai, many of whom worked side jobs to make a living
                        153] Discontented samurai were soon to play a major role in engineering the downfall of the Tokugawa shogunate.
                    </p>

        <h1>V. Modern Japan</h1>
        <h2>Reiwa period (2019-Present) </h2> 
        <p style = "text-align: justify;">
            On December 16, 2022, Japan announced a major shift in its military policy by acquiring counterstrike capabilities and a defense budget increase
             to 2% of GDP ¥43 trillion ($315 billion) by 2027.[308] [309] The impetus are regional security concerns over China, North-Korea and Russia.
             [308] This will leapfrog Japan from ninth to the world's third-largest defense spender, behind the United States and China.
