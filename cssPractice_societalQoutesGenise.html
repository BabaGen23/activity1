            may have the opportunity to earn respect, responsibility, advancement and remuneration base on <em class="sth">inheritance</em> ability.</q>

        <p  class="p2">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<q>Shall I not infrom you of a better act than fasting, alms, and prayers? Making peace between one another: enmity and
                malice tear up heavenly rewards by the roots.</q>
